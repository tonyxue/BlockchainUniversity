 **STUDENT REPORT** 

 *10 Minutes: Report on the current progress regarding thesis, projects, etc.*

Happy Chinese New Year!

 - XLP Evaluation Framework
	 - I have worked with Ben and Prof. Tsai and we finalized the paper. It was successfully submitted to IEEE by Tuesday. 
 - Other
	- I read Social Physics and it does cover many similar topics related to XLP, emphasizing on collective learning and mentioning markets becoming exchanges.  I think it provides a good reference and in the context of emails Ben sent from NYC, I think there are many potentials to bring the XLP design on a new level. Regarding Prof. Tsai's questions about communication patterns during XLP, I think it is relatively difficult for me to identify those, since most communication between team members took place offline and my Chinese skills are not sufficient to do qualitative analysis of learning blogs and meeting minutes to identify such patterns.


 

**FEEDBACK **
 
 *10 Minutes: Professor's feedback regarding student's current progress.*
 


**OPEN BUSINESS**

*10 Minutes: Open discussion of current and future business*

- Travel
	- Past few days I have been travelling in China. I will be in Tianjin this weekend and will come back to Beijing on Feb. 24th. 

**COMMITMENTS**

*5 Minutes: Plans and schedules for future work and follow-ups*



***Kuba***:

- Discuss with Ben and Prof. Tsai the possible upcoming paper for IEEE journal
- Communicate with Woody regarding preparation for future XLP design, workflows and data collection strategies.
- Work with Prof. Tsai regarding the mathematical model of the game theory of moving targets for XLP

***Ben***:

- This is an effective, yet succinct summary. However, next time, when you plan to have a long vacation, please send me an email ahead of time. This is the winter vacation, so that your absence is understood. In anycase, close communication never hurts.
- We should start writing the next paper. On top of the IEEE Transaction on Education, we should also identify other publications for potential publications.
- With Social Physics, we can leverage a lot of terminologies Pentland used for analysis. A key term is "Idea Flow". We can study its math and come up with a way to use Git data to extract Idea Flow.
- Prof. Tsai has been very instrumental in writing these papers. The Game Theory model can be integrated with Idea Flow. This should be the main focus of discussion. Idea Flow metrics can provide the dynamics of the moving targets or what Ideas caused targets to move.
